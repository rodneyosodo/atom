# POST /authz/explain

> Legacy draft note: this document still uses the old policy/scope terminology. The authoritative product model is now [Atom access model](./11-access-model-simplification.md). Update this endpoint contract before implementation so it explains role permission blocks, assignments, Object Groups, and Principal Groups instead of `scope_kind` / `scope_ref`.

## Priority: 1 (Must-have)

---

## Problem

The current `POST /authz/check` returns `{"allowed": true/false, "reason": "..."}`. When access is denied, operators have no way to understand **why** — which bindings were evaluated, which ones matched, which one caused the denial, and whether the access came through a direct binding or a group.

Debugging authorization issues currently requires reading the database directly.

## Endpoint

```
POST /authz/explain
```

**Authentication:** Bearer token required.

---

## Request

Same as `POST /authz/check`:

```json
{
  "subject_id":  "uuid",
  "action":      "read",
  "resource_id": "uuid",
  "context":     {}
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `subject_id` | UUID | Yes | The entity attempting the action |
| `action` | string | Yes | The action name (e.g. `read`, `publish`, `manage`) |
| `resource_id` | UUID | Yes | The target resource |
| `context` | object | No | Additional ABAC context (default `{}`) |

## Response fields

### Top level

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `allowed` | bool | Final decision |

| `subject` | object | Resolved subject entity (id, name, kind, status) |
| `resource` | object | Resolved resource (id, kind, name, tenant_id) |
| `capability` | object \| null | Resolved capability for the action, or null if action not found |
| `matched_binding` | object \| null | The binding that determined the final decision (null if no match) |
| `evaluated_bindings` | array | All bindings that were evaluated, in evaluation order |

### `matched_binding` and `evaluated_bindings[]`

## Early exit responses

If evaluation stops before reaching bindings:

**Subject not found:**
```json
{
  "allowed": false,
  "reason": "subject not found",
  "subject": null,
  "resource": null,
  "capability": null,
  "matched_binding": null,
  "evaluated_bindings": []
}
```

**Subject not active:**
```json
{
  "allowed": false,
  "reason": "subject is not active",
  "subject": { "id": "...", "name": "...", "kind": "device", "status": "suspended" },
  "resource": null,
  "capability": null,
  "matched_binding": null,
  "evaluated_bindings": []
}
```

**Unknown action:**
```json
{
  "allowed": false,
  "reason": "unknown action 'foo'",
  "subject": { "id": "...", "name": "...", "kind": "human", "status": "active" },
  "resource": { "id": "...", "kind": "channel", "name": "...", "tenant_id": "..." },
  "capability": null,
  "matched_binding": null,
  "evaluated_bindings": []
}
```

## Implementation notes

- Reuses the same evaluation logic as `engine::evaluate()`, but collects diagnostic information at each step instead of short-circuiting silently.
- The `via` field requires joining `group_members` → `groups` to resolve group names for bindings where `subject_kind = group`.
- Performance: this endpoint does more work than `/authz/check` (resolving names, collecting all binding evaluations). It should be used for debugging, not in hot paths.
- This endpoint also writes an audit log entry with event `authz.explain`.

## Example scenarios

### Scenario 1: Allowed via role through a group

Alice is in group `engineers`. Group `engineers` has a policy: role `editor` on `resource_kind = channel`, effect `allow`. Alice tries to `write` to a channel.

Response: `allowed: true`, `matched_binding.via = "group:engineers"`, `matched_binding.role_name = "editor"`.

### Scenario 2: Denied — deny overrides allow

Device `sensor-01` has a direct allow binding for `read` on all channels. But group `restricted-devices` (which `sensor-01` is a member of) has a deny binding for `read` on `resource_kind = channel`.

Response: `allowed: false`, `matched_binding.effect = "deny"`, `matched_binding.via = "group:restricted-devices"`. The allow binding appears in `evaluated_bindings` with `result: "matched"` but was overridden.

### Scenario 3: Denied — no matching policy

A new service entity has no policy bindings at all.

Response: `allowed: false`, `reason: "no matching allow policy"`, `matched_binding: null`, `evaluated_bindings: []`.
