# GET /entities/:id/effective-capabilities

> Legacy draft note: this document still uses the old policy/scope terminology. The authoritative product model is now [Atom access model](./11-access-model-simplification.md). Update this endpoint contract before implementation so effective actions are resolved from role permission blocks, assignments, and optional advanced conditions.

## Priority: 2 (Should-have)

---

## Problem

An entity's actual capabilities come from multiple sources — direct capability bindings, roles (which bundle capabilities), and group memberships (which inherit bindings). There is no single view that shows the **flattened, deduplicated list** of what an entity can actually do.

This is different from the entity access endpoint (#2), which shows access per-resource. This endpoint answers: "What actions can this entity perform, regardless of which resource?" — a capability-centric view rather than a resource-centric view.

## Response fields

### Top level

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `entity_id` | UUID | The entity being queried |
| `entity_name` | string | Entity name |
| `entity_kind` | string | Entity kind |
| `capabilities` | array | Deduplicated list of capabilities with their sources |

### Each capability

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID | Capability ID |
| `name` | string | Capability name (e.g. `read`, `publish`) |
| `resource_kind` | string \| null | Which resource kind this capability applies to (null = all kinds) |
| `sources` | array | Every path through which this entity holds this capability |

### Each source

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | `capability` \| `role` | Whether the binding grants this capability directly or via a role |
| `role_id` | UUID \| null | Role ID if kind = role |
| `role_name` | string \| null | Role name if kind = role |
| `policy_id` | UUID | The policy binding |
| `scope_kind` | `all` \| `resource_kind` \| `resource` | Scope of the binding |
| `scope_ref` | string \| null | Scope reference |
| `effect` | `allow` \| `deny` | Effect — deny sources are included so admins can see blocks |
| `via` | string | `"direct"` or `"group:<group-name>"` |

---

## Why `sources` matters

The same capability can reach an entity through multiple independent paths:

```
read ← viewer role ← direct binding (scope: channels)
read ← editor role ← group:ops-team binding (scope: all)
```

If an admin revokes the direct viewer binding, the entity still has `read` through the ops-team group. The `sources` array makes this visible — an admin knows exactly what to revoke to fully remove a capability.

---

## Use cases

### 1. "What can Alice do?"

```
GET /entities/aaa/effective-capabilities
```

### 2. "What can this device do with channel resources?"

```
GET /entities/bbb/effective-capabilities?resource_kind=channel
```

### 3. "What capabilities does this service have in tenant 1?"

```
GET /entities/ccc/effective-capabilities?tenant_id=t1
```

### 4. "Before revoking a role, will the entity still have access?"

Check if the capability appears with multiple sources. If yes, revoking one source won't fully remove the capability.

## Implementation notes

- Load all bindings for the entity (direct + group), same query as the PDP engine.
- For role bindings, expand via `role_capabilities` to get individual capability IDs.
- For direct capability bindings, the capability is the `grant_id` itself.
- Group capability IDs by capability, deduplicate, and attach sources.
- Deny-effect sources are included in the response — they don't grant access but show that a deny exists for that capability.
- The response is not paginated — it's a flat list of distinct capabilities, which is typically small (< 50 even in complex setups).
- If the entity is not found, return `404`.
