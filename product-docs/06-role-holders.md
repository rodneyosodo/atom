# GET /roles/:id/holders

> Legacy draft note: this document still uses the old policy/scope terminology. The authoritative product model is now [Atom access model](./11-access-model-simplification.md). Update this endpoint contract before implementation so holders are resolved from role assignments to entities and Principal Groups.

## Priority: 2 (Should-have)

## Problem

Before modifying or deleting a role, an administrator needs to know: **"Who holds this role, and how will they be affected?"**

Today there is no way to answer this without scanning all policy bindings with `grant_kind = role`, filtering by `grant_id`, and then resolving the subject IDs to entities and groups.

## Use cases

### 1. "Who holds the editor role?"

```
GET /roles/v2/holders
```

### 2. "Before deleting this role, who will lose access?"

```
GET /roles/v1/holders
```

The response shows every entity and group that holds this role. The administrator can review and reassign before deleting.

### 3. "Which groups hold this role?"

```
GET /roles/v1/holders?subject_kind=group
```

## Implementation notes

- Query: `SELECT * FROM policy_bindings WHERE grant_kind = 'role' AND grant_id = $1`, then join entities/groups for details.
- For group subjects, `member_count` is computed via `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM group_members WHERE group_id = $1`.
- The `capabilities` array on the role object uses the existing `role_capabilities` join.
- If the role is not found, return `404`.
