# ATOM — Identity & Authorization Service

**Version:** 0.1  
**License:** Apache-2.0  
**Language:** Rust (Axum + PostgreSQL)  

---

## Purpose

Atom is a unified Identity + Authorization service for IoT and cloud-native systems — the auth layer for Magistrala and similar platforms.

It replaces Keycloak with a minimal, fast, single-binary service that is simple to deploy and operate.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Entity-first** — everything is an entity (human, device, service, workload, application). No special user class.
2. **Online authorization** — tokens carry no permissions; all decisions evaluated at runtime.
3. **Deny-by-default** — explicit DENY overrides any ALLOW; no matching policy → deny.
4. **Single binary** — one deployable service, one Postgres database.
5. **UUID everywhere** — primary keys are UUIDs.
6. **JSONB attributes** — flexible schemaless attributes on entities and resources, usable in ABAC conditions.

---

## Architecture

```
Atom
├── Identity Module    — entities, credentials, sessions, groups, ownerships
├── Authorization Module — resources, roles, capabilities, policy bindings, PDP engine
└── Audit Module       — immutable event log (table, hooks not yet wired)
```

## Core Concepts

### Entity
Any principal: `human | device | service | workload | application`.  
Has a `kind`, a `name` (unique per tenant), arbitrary `attributes` (JSONB), and a `status`.

`kind` is Atom's internal runtime and authorization classification. It is the value used by the PDP for subject kind, object type, guardrails, and scope matching.

### Profile
User/domain-customizable subtype and schema layer for entities and future object types. For entities, a profile keeps `entities.kind` internal while allowing domain keys such as `client`, `gateway`, or `water_meter`.

`profile_version` points at the JSON Schema used to validate `entities.attributes` on create and attribute update. It is for schema validation/history only and is not used by authorization.

### Credential
Attached to an entity. Kinds: `password | api_key | certificate`.  
- Password: argon2-hashed, looked up by entity name.  
- API key: format `atom_<32-hex-cred-id>_<64-hex-secret>`. ID-embedded for O(1) lookup. Secret is argon2-hashed. Only shown once on creation.

### Session
Created on login. Referenced by JWT (`sub=entity_id, sid=session_id`). Can be revoked.

### Group
Named collection of entities, scoped per tenant. Used as policy subjects.

### Ownership
Parent-child relation between entities (`owner_id → owned_id`). Supports any `relation` type string.

### Resource
Anything protected by authorization: channel, device, workspace, secret, node, etc.  
Has a `kind`, optional `name`, `tenant_id`, `owner_id`, and JSONB `attributes`.

### Capability
Atomic permission, optionally scoped to a resource kind.  
Seeded defaults: `read, write, delete, publish, subscribe, execute, manage`.

### Role
Named bundle of capabilities, scoped per tenant.

### Policy Binding
Grants (or denies) a capability or role to a subject (entity or group) over a resource scope.

| Field          | Values                              |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| `subject_kind` | `entity` \| `group`                 |
| `grant_kind`   | `capability` \| `role`              |
| `scope_kind`   | `all` \| `resource_kind` \| `resource` |
| `scope_ref`    | kind name or resource UUID (text)   |
| `effect`       | `allow` \| `deny`                   |
| `conditions`   | JSONB dot-path ABAC conditions      |

## Authorization Flow (PDP)

```
POST /authz/check  {subject_id, action, resource_id, context?}
```

1. Load entity (check active)
2. Load resource (check exists)
3. Find capability by action name (matched against resource kind)
4. Load all policy bindings for entity (direct + via group membership)
5. For each binding:
   - Check scope matches the resource
   - Check grant covers the capability (direct or via role)
   - Evaluate ABAC conditions against `{entity.attributes, resource.attributes, context}`
6. **DENY wins** — first matching deny returns immediately
7. If any allow matched → `allowed: true`
8. Otherwise → `allowed: false`

### ABAC Conditions

Conditions are a flat JSON object where keys are dot-paths into the evaluation context and values are the expected values. All entries must match (AND logic).

```json
{
  "entity.attributes.department": "engineering",
  "resource.attributes.env": "prod",
  "context.ip_trusted": "true"
}
```

The evaluation context is:
```json
{
  "entity":   { "attributes": { ... } },
  "resource": { "attributes": { ... } },
  "context":  { ... }          // from the check request
}
```

## Authentication

All endpoints except `GET /health` and `POST /auth/login` require:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

- **JWT** (short-lived, default 1h): returned by `/auth/login`
- **API key** (long-lived): format `atom_<...>` — passes `Authorization: Bearer atom_...`

---

## Multi-tenancy

- Entities, groups, resources, and roles all carry an optional `tenant_id`.
- Filtering by `tenant_id` is supported on all list endpoints.
- Cross-tenant access requires an explicit policy binding.

---

## Future
- SCIM provisioning
- External IdP (OIDC federation)
- Workload identity (SPIFFE/X.509)
- Audit log webhooks
- Token introspection endpoint
